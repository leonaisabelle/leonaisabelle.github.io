      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a data-driven professional with a passion for global development. Previously, I was at the World Bank in Washington, D.C. analyzing satellite data to understand traffic patterns in Haiti as well as working with donor partners on development finance instruments. I was also at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris where I applied policy analysis to provide evidence-based recommendations to governments seeking to reform their investment policies. I obtained a Master of International Affairs degree from Columbia Universityâ€™s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) with a focus on economic development policy and I am currently completing an Advanced Certificate in Applied Data Science and Informatics at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am interested in applying the following tools and techniques to help solve poverty and development challenges:
&lt;strong&gt;data science&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;data visualization&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;spatial analysis&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
