run the website locally

side note: be sure to be located at the root of the repository
before running the following command

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

then go to http://127.0.0.1:4000 to see your website.

you can also go to http://localhost:4000 because localhost is an alias for 127.0.0.1 (which you can see in the file /etc/hosts)
